# News-Classification-Deployment

News articles are important for providing timely, historic information. However, the Internet is replete with text that may contain irrelevant or unhelpful information, therefore the means of processing it and distilling content is important and useful to human readers as well as information extracting tools. Some common questions we may want to answer are “what is this article about?”. In this work, we compare machine learning and deep learning models for evaluating an NLP task, Classification Dataset of news categories was from Board Infinity. The categories of the dependent variable contain multi-class, the results are predicted based on the type of class, using few machine learning classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, XGBoost, Random Forest Classifier and also with deep learning LSTM model too. Additionally, we use the models to classify unknown text data.
